## Teamspeak IP notifier
### How does it work ?
This software scan every 7.5minutes the public IP of his machine. When the IP has changed it will notify some users on a Facebook group using the Facebook API.

### Why this software exists ?
I live in Belgium and here the mobile telecommunications operators doesn"t provide a static IP for free. You need to pay about 30â‚¬/month to have access to this feature. That's a lot of money for absolutely nothing... As I host a teamspeak server on a Raspberry PI for some friends, that's a problem for me. Indeed, I need to notify them as soon as the IP has changed. That's why I created this small software to notify them when it happens.
