## Teamspeak DDNS notifier
### How does it work ?
This software scan every <b>x</b> minutes its network public IP. When the IP has changed, it will send the new one to a DDNS service API. 
Using this system, we can, for example, host a private teamspeak server on a raspberry PI without paying an overpriced mobile telecommunications operators offer including static IP.
